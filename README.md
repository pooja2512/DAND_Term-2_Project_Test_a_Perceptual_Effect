# DAND_term2_project_test_a_perceptual_phenomenon


## Background Information

> In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed.for example: the word "BLUE" is printed in a BLUE color, you should say "BLUE". In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example if the word "BLUE" is printed in a red color, you should say "RED". In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

Interference in Stroop Effect occurs because humans can read more faster than naming the colors of words.Also because naming colors of the words require more attention.

> Applications

1.Stroop Effect is commonly used in clinical settings. An increased interference effect is found in disorders such as brain damage, dementias
2.Stroop effect serves as an information processing approach to emotions this approach is called as emotional Stroop.Participant is given negative emotional words as well as neural words and participant has to name the colors of the words. study has found participant who are depressed are more likely to say color of negative emotion words than neural words.
To sum up,Stroop effect permit to measure a person's selective attention capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability
